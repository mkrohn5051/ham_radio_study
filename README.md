Quick and dirty flashcards with latest General and Amateur Extra questions and answers.

Super simple: download the question sets from https://www.ncvec.org/.  These are freely available to the public.  I modified the .csv downloads by adding a "Correct Answer" column that simply checks what the index is and pulls that column closer to the question.  That's it!

Requirements for this (no separate file):
Python version:
Python 3.12

Packages of the 3.12 variety:
tkinter
csv
sys
os
